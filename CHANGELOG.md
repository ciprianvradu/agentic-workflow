This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Micro workflow mode** — auto-detected for typos, whitespace, spelling fixes; runs implementer only (~$0.03)
- **Planner agent** — combined architect+developer for standard/turbo mode single-pass planning
- **Config split** — essential settings in `workflow-config.yaml`, advanced/power-user settings in `workflow-config-advanced.yaml`; loaded via cascade (advanced first, essential overlays)
- **Config caching** — `config_get_effective()` caches merged config with 5-minute TTL, invalidated by file mtime changes
- **Global severity scale** — unified 4-level scale (Critical/High/Medium/Low) in `docs/ai-context/severity-scale.md`, referenced by all agents
- **Shared prompt sections** — extracted Memory Preservation, Completion Signals, and Doc Gap Flagging into `docs/ai-context/` reference docs (~428 lines removed from agents)
- **MCP tool categories** — all 69 tools categorized as core (29) or extra (40) in `docs/mcp-tool-categories.md`
- **Auto-detection documentation** — keyword matching, file scope analysis, and mode ranking documented in `architecture.md`

### Changed
- **Agent hand-off improvements** — skeptic output now flows to implementer context; REVISE loopback routing added
- **Conditional technical writer** — skipped in standard mode when no documentation gaps flagged
- **Orchestrator spec moved** — `agents/orchestrator.md` → `docs/orchestrator-spec.md` (not an agent, is a specification)
- **MCP server enum** — `workflow_transition` tool now accepts `quality_guard`, `feedback`, and `planner` as valid phases
- Essential config reduced from ~758 lines to ~270 lines

### Fixed
- MCP enum validation rejecting `quality_guard` and `feedback` phase transitions
- Auto-detection correctly routes "typo" tasks to micro mode instead of standard

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Workflow mode consolidation** — 4 modes (full/turbo/fast/minimal) consolidated to 3 (standard/reviewed/thorough) with backward-compatible aliases
- **Functional model routing** — per-mode, per-agent model config in `workflow-config.yaml` with fallback chain: `models.<mode>.<agent>` → `models.<agent>` → `models.default`
- **Deterministic checkpoint invocation** — `_should_trigger_checkpoint()` evaluates `concern_threshold` + `concern_severity_threshold` from config; `_build_checkpoint_result()` returns pre-built question/options for `AskUserQuestion`
- **Path traversal guard** — `_is_safe_task_id()` validates task IDs, rejecting `../`, `/`, `\`, null bytes
- **Shell injection protection** — `shlex.quote()` applied to all git command variables in `workflow_create_worktree()` and `workflow_cleanup_worktree()`
- **Concurrent workflow guard** — `workflow_guard_acquire()`/`workflow_guard_release()` with FileLock prevents two orchestrators on the same task
- **Error pattern JSONL rotation** — `MAX_ERROR_PATTERNS=500` with oldest-first eviction in `workflow_record_error_pattern()`
- **File scope analysis** — `_analyze_file_scope()` with `SCOPE_ESCALATION_RULES` enhances `workflow_detect_mode()` combining keyword + scope signals
- **KB listing timeout** — `_list_kb_files()` with 10s timeout and 500-file cap prevents init stalling on large trees
- **Beads validation** — `_validate_beads_issue()` checks issue exists before emitting `bd close` commands
- **Deterministic CLI scripts** — 4 Python scripts replace LLM-driven commands, saving ~5K tokens per invocation:
  - `scripts/crew-config.py` — formatted config table from YAML cascade
  - `scripts/crew-status.py` — task status table from state.json files
  - `scripts/crew-cost-report.py` — cost breakdown per agent/model
  - `scripts/crew-stats.py` — mode distribution, iteration stats, error patterns
- **Script bundling in build system** — `BUNDLED_SCRIPTS` in `build-agents.py`, Claude build copies scripts to `~/.claude/scripts/`
- **Task templates** — 5 example templates in `examples/` (bug-fix, new-feature, migration, refactor, new-endpoint)
- **Security test suite** — 43 tests covering path traversal, shell injection, oversized inputs, symlink escape, input validation, error pattern integrity, concurrent access
- **Checkpoint test suite** — 7 tests for deterministic checkpoint triggering with threshold and severity filtering
- Checkpoint config: `concern_threshold` (default: 0 = always) and `concern_severity_threshold` (default: low)
- 618 tests total (up from 509)

### Changed
- `agents/crew-status.md` and `agents/crew-stats.md` — reduced to thin wrappers calling Python scripts
- `commands/crew-config.md` and `commands/crew-cost-report.md` — reduced to thin wrappers calling Python scripts
- `crew_get_next_phase()` — checkpoint path now uses `_should_trigger_checkpoint()` + `_build_checkpoint_result()` instead of raw dict construction

### Fixed
- **Phase init bug** — standard mode (no architect) no longer gets stuck with `phase="architect"` that never produces output; `workflow_initialize()` sets `phase=None`, `crew_init_task()` sets it after mode is determined
- **Path traversal in `find_task_dir()`** — task IDs with `../` could escape `.tasks/` directory
- **Shell injection in worktree commands** — branch names with metacharacters (`; rm -rf /`, backticks, `$()`) were interpolated unquoted into git commands
- **Unquoted cleanup script args** — `workflow_cleanup_worktree()` now quotes all script arguments

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **`{__scripts_dir__}` template placeholder** — new build-time placeholder for agent and command source files, alongside existing `{__platform__}` and `{__platform_dir__}`. Resolved per platform by `build-agents.py`:
  - Claude: `~/.claude/scripts` (globally installed alongside agents)
  - Copilot/Gemini/OpenCode: absolute repo path at build time (e.g., `/home/user/agentic-workflow/scripts`)
- `SCRIPTS_DIRS` mapping in `build-agents.py` defines per-platform script directory resolution
- `_assert_no_raw_placeholders()` now checks for un-substituted `{__scripts_dir__}` in built output
- `commands/*.md` files are now processed through `_substitute_platform()` during `build_claude()` (previously copied raw by `install.sh`)
- `crew-board` Rust binary adds `~/.claude/scripts/` as fallback path when the repo-relative cleanup script is not found

### Fixed
- **Script paths break when agents installed globally** — agents and commands referenced `python3 scripts/crew_orchestrator.py` with relative paths that only worked when CWD was the agentic-workflow repo. Since Claude runs commands from whatever project the user is working in, this caused "No such file or directory" errors after global install
- MCP server (`orchestration_tools.py`, `state_tools.py`) now uses `_REPO_ROOT`-based absolute paths for cleanup script references

### Changed
- `commands/crew.md` — 9 occurrences of `python3 scripts/` replaced with `python3 {__scripts_dir__}/`
- `agents/crew-worktree.md` — 2 occurrences replaced
- `agents/crew-status.md` — 3 occurrences replaced
- `install.sh` no longer copies `commands/*.md` raw — `build_claude()` handles all command file processing with proper placeholder substitution

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **OpenCode platform support** — fourth AI host alongside Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Gemini CLI
- 11 sub-agents in `.opencode/agents/` with YAML frontmatter (`mode: subagent`, per-agent `tools:` boolean restrictions)
- 5 slash commands in `.opencode/commands/` (`crew`, `crew-config`, `crew-resume`, `crew-status`, `crew-worktree`) with `$ARGUMENTS` substitution
- `config/platform-preambles/opencode.md` — tool discipline and git safety rules
- `config/platform-orchestrators/opencode.md` — `@crew-{agent}` mention-based sub-agent delegation
- `install-opencode.sh` — builds agents globally/locally, registers MCP server in `opencode.json`
- `"opencode"` added to `ai_host` enum in MCP tool schemas (`workflow_create_worktree`, `workflow_get_launch_command`)
- `opencode` launch command: `opencode run "prompt"` for non-interactive execution
- `.opencode` added to `PLATFORM_DIRS` config cascade
- OpenCode uses `/crew resume` slash syntax (native Claude command compatibility)
- `build_opencode()` in `build-agents.py` with `OPENCODE_AGENT_TOOLS` tool restriction map
- 9 new tests: config path detection (5), worktree settings (1), launch/resume (3)

### Changed
- `PLATFORMS` registry in `build-agents.py` now includes `"opencode"` (4 platforms total)
- Documentation updated across README.md, ai-context docs, crew-board docs, copilot-instructions.md, ideas.md
- `config/workflow-config.yaml` `ai_host` comment updated to include `opencode`

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Crew interaction history logging** — `workflow_log_interaction` MCP tool appends structured entries to `.tasks/TASK_XXX/interactions.jsonl`, capturing human-AI conversation throughout the `/crew` workflow for documentation and context recovery
- `log-interaction` subcommand in `crew_orchestrator.py` — CLI wrapper for the MCP tool, callable from all platforms
- `--question` flag on `checkpoint-done` — logs both the checkpoint question and user response to `interactions.jsonl` automatically
- Interaction logging instructions in `crew.md` at init, checkpoint, escalation, and ad-hoc guidance points
- `workflow_log_interaction` added to worktree permissions template
- 9 new tests in `TestInteractionLogging`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Crew orchestrator CLI** — `scripts/crew_orchestrator.py` batches multiple MCP tool calls into single instant JSON decisions, replacing LLM interpretation of procedural routing logic. Subcommands: `init`, `next`, `agent-done`, `checkpoint-done`, `impl-action`, `complete`, `resume`
- **`crew_jira_transition` MCP tool** — encapsulates the 6-step Jira transition procedure into a single call returning skip/prompt/execute action based on config
- **Mode-aware phase transitions** — `_can_transition()` now allows forward skips when intermediate phases are not in the current workflow mode (e.g., developer → implementer in minimal mode)
- `crew_get_resume_state` documented in architecture.md
- 24 new tests for orchestrator CLI (`test_crew_orchestrator.py`), 7 new tests for Jira transition

### Changed
- **`commands/crew.md` rewritten** — 225 → 123 lines (-45%). Procedural routing logic replaced with orchestrator script calls. Kept: prompt composition, checkpoint presentation, error handling, agent spawning
- Architecture docs updated with new orchestrator script section and test organization

### Fixed
- `crew_parse_agent_output` called `workflow_add_review_issue` with wrong parameter names (`issue=` instead of `issue_type=`, `description=`)
- `crew_parse_agent_output` called `workflow_add_concern` with wrong parameter names (`concern=`, `raised_by=` instead of `source=`, `description=`)
- Phase transitions rejected valid forward skips in turbo/fast/minimal modes

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Worktree recycling** — finished worktrees can be kept on disk (`keep_on_disk=True`) and reused by future tasks (`recycle=True`), avoiding slow full checkouts on large repos
- `_find_recyclable_worktree()` helper — scans `.tasks/*/state.json` for worktrees with `status: "recyclable"` where the directory still exists
- `recycle` parameter on `workflow_create_worktree` — when True and a recyclable candidate exists, returns `git worktree move` + `git checkout` commands instead of `git worktree add`; marks donor as `recycled`
- `keep_on_disk` parameter on `workflow_cleanup_worktree` — when True, sets status to `recyclable` and omits `git worktree remove` command
- **Pre-creation sync check** — `crew-worktree` now fetches from remote and warns if the base branch is behind before creating a worktree (agent-side, no new MCP tool)
- `worktree.recycle` config option (`prompt` | `auto` | `never`, default: `prompt`)
- `worktree.sync_before_create` config option (`prompt` | `auto` | `never`, default: `prompt`)
- Branch column in `/crew-status` summary table — shows `crew/branch-name` for each task
- `recyclable` worktree status and action in `list_tasks()` and `/crew-status`
- 10 new tests in `TestWorktreeRecycling`

### Changed
- `crew-worktree.md` renumbered to 15 steps (new step 2: sync check, step 7: recycle resolution, steps 11/12 skip for recycled worktrees, step 13: enhanced output format)
- `/crew-status` worktree overview now shows recyclable worktrees and `keep_on_disk` option on cleanup candidates
- `workflow_cleanup_worktree` rejects worktrees with status `recyclable` (in addition to `cleaned`)
- `list_tasks()` maps `recycled` status to `done` action, `recyclable` to `recyclable` action

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Worktree DX auto-setup** — `workflow_create_worktree()` returns `setup_commands` that symlink `.tasks/` and copy host settings with `additionalDirectories` patched in, granting the worktree session read/write access to the parent repo's `.tasks/`
- **Cross-platform `/crew-status`** — moved from Claude-only `commands/` to `agents/crew-status.md`, now available on Claude (`/crew-status`), Copilot (`@crew-status`), and Gemini (`@crew-status`)
- **Worktree-aware task summary** — `list_tasks()` includes worktree metadata (status, path, branch, action); `/crew-status` shows worktree columns, cleanup candidates, orphan detection via `git worktree list`
- **Host-aware resume prompt** — `_build_resume_prompt()` uses `/crew resume` for Claude, `@crew-resume` for Gemini/Copilot
- `ai_host` parameter on `workflow_create_worktree` MCP tool — determines which settings to copy
- `copy_settings` config option in `worktree:` section — disable settings copy while keeping `.tasks/` symlink
- `_HOST_SETTINGS` constant maps hosts to settings files (Claude: `.claude/settings.local.json`, Gemini/Copilot: none)
- `_SETTINGS_PATCH_SCRIPT` — Python script embedded in setup_commands that copies settings and injects `additionalDirectories`
- 24 new tests: setup_commands, host-aware resume, list_tasks worktree, resume prompt content

### Fixed
- **Worktree-aware active task detection** — `_find_active_task_dir()` (MCP server) and `find_active_task()` (hooks) now detect which worktree they're in and return only the task that owns it, preventing cross-task interference when multiple worktrees are active
- **`/crew-status` read-only enforcement** — added explicit READ-ONLY guard, allowed/forbidden tool lists, preventing the agent from accidentally advancing workflows when displaying status

### Changed
- Resume prompt now explicitly warns: "DO NOT create a new .tasks/ directory" and directs to use absolute path
- `crew-worktree.md` renumbered to 13 steps (new step 5: resolve AI host, step 8: run setup_commands)
- MCP tool count: 55 → 55 (ai_host added to existing tool schema)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Git worktree support** — `/crew-worktree` creates isolated worktrees per task, enabling parallel workflows on the same repo without file conflicts
- `/crew-worktree` available on all 3 platforms: Claude Code (slash command), Copilot CLI (`@crew-worktree`), Gemini CLI (`@crew-worktree`)
- Single source `agents/crew-worktree.md` → build script generates platform-specific output
- `COMMAND_AGENTS` concept in `build-agents.py` — command-type agents generate slash commands for Claude and full-access agents for Copilot/Gemini
- 3 new MCP tools: `workflow_create_worktree`, `workflow_get_worktree_info`, `workflow_cleanup_worktree` (record metadata and return git commands; do not execute git directly)
- Worktree-aware `get_tasks_dir()` — resolves `.tasks/` back to the main repo via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` when running in a worktree
- Worktree config section in `workflow-config.yaml` (`base_path`, `branch_prefix`, `cleanup_on_complete`)
- WSL/Windows compatibility: worktree `.git` paths automatically converted to relative paths
- Worktree cleanup in crew.md Step 9 (Completion)
- 12 new tests in `TestWorktreeSupport`

### Changed
- Platform preambles updated: "Do NOT use git worktree" changed to "Do NOT use git worktree directly (use MCP tools instead)"
- Build script now generates `commands/` (Claude) in addition to `agents/` for command-type agents
- MCP tool count: 52 → 55

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Multi-platform build system** — `scripts/build-agents.py` transforms shared agent sources into Claude Code, Copilot CLI, and Gemini CLI formats
- **Gemini CLI support** — sub-agent `.md` files with YAML frontmatter (name, description, kind, tools, max_turns), per-agent tool restrictions, `install-gemini.sh` / `uninstall-gemini.sh`
- **Platform orchestrators** — `config/platform-orchestrators/copilot.md` (runSubagent chaining) and `config/platform-orchestrators/gemini.md` (autonomous description-based routing)
- **Gemini platform preamble** — `config/platform-preambles/gemini.md` with Gemini-native tool names (read_file, grep_search, etc.)
- **`.gemini` config path** — added to `PLATFORM_DIRS` so config cascade checks `~/.gemini/workflow-config.yaml`
- 5 new tests for `.gemini` config path detection and precedence

### Changed
- **Technical Writer always runs** — included in all workflow modes (full, turbo, fast, minimal) to keep documentation in sync
- All agents (Developer, Reviewer, Skeptic, Implementer, Feedback) now flag documentation gaps via `workflow_mark_docs_needed`
- Platform orchestrators fixed: "quick" mode renamed to correct "fast"/"minimal" names, added missing mode definitions
- `install.sh` now uses `scripts/build-agents.py claude` instead of inline shell loop
- `install-copilot.ps1` now uses `scripts/build-agents.py copilot` instead of inline PowerShell loop
- `install-copilot.ps1` cleans up old-format `crew-*.md` files (without `.agent.md` extension) on install
- Copilot orchestrator (`crew.agent.md`) gets `tools: ["*"]` in frontmatter
- Generated `.github/agents/` files are now gitignored (rebuilt on install)
- README rewritten with three-platform feature comparison table, install instructions for all platforms, updated config/contributing/uninstall sections
- `copilot-instructions.md` config section updated to mention `.gemini/` fallback

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- `/crew-config` command was reading `crew-config.yaml` instead of `workflow-config.yaml`
- `/crew-config` displayed hardcoded defaults instead of actual config values

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Workflow modes** — full, turbo, fast, minimal modes with auto-detection (`--mode`)
- **Effort levels** — per-agent thinking depth (low/medium/high/max) mapped to Anthropic API parameters (`thinking: {"type": "adaptive"}`, `output_config: {"effort": "<level>"}`)
- **Server-side compaction** — config for Anthropic API `compact-2026-01-12` model with custom preservation instructions
- **Compaction cost tracking** — `compaction_tokens` parameter on `workflow_record_cost` for tracking compaction iteration costs
- **Agent teams (experimental)** — `workflow_get_agent_team_config` MCP tool and config section for parallel review and parallel implementation via Claude Code agent teams
- **Subagent limits** — `max_turns` caps on all Task calls (30 planning, 50 implementation, 20 docs, 15 consultation) and `agent_timeout` config
- **Tool Discipline** — all 11 agent prompts now include guidance to use Grep/Glob/Read directly instead of spawning Task subagents for discovery
- **Specialist agents** — security auditor, performance analyst, API guardian, accessibility reviewer (auto-triggered)
- **Quality assertions** — `workflow_add_assertion`, `workflow_verify_assertion` for defining and checking quality gates
- **Error pattern learning** — `workflow_record_error_pattern`, `workflow_match_error` for matching errors to known solutions

- **Parallelization** — `workflow_start_parallel_phase`, `workflow_complete_parallel_phase`, `workflow_merge_parallel_results` for running Reviewer+Skeptic concurrently
- **Cost tracking** — `workflow_record_cost`, `workflow_get_cost_summary` with per-agent/model breakdowns and long-context pricing
- **Opus 4.6 support** — updated model names, pricing ($5/$25 standard, $10/$37.50 long-context), turbo mode for single-pass planning
- **Native context preference** — skip Gemini if repomix output fits in Opus 4.6's context (`native_context_threshold_kb: 800`)
- CHANGELOG.md, VERSION file, release process documentation

### Changed
- Model fallback chain updated: claude-opus-4-6 > claude-opus-4 > claude-sonnet-4 > gemini
- Effort level comments in config now document Anthropic API parameter mapping
