## Shared Agent Standards

### Memory Preservation

Use `workflow_save_discovery()` to persist important findings across context windows. See `{knowledge_base}/memory-preservation.md` for the full protocol.

At start of your phase, call `workflow_get_discoveries()` or `workflow_flush_context()` to load findings from earlier phases. At end, save decisions, patterns, gotchas, and blockers relevant to downstream agents.

### Documentation Gap Flagging

When you encounter undocumented or outdated code, call `workflow_mark_docs_needed()` to flag it for the Technical Writer. See `{knowledge_base}/doc-gap-flagging.md` for details.

### Completion Signals

See `{knowledge_base}/completion-signals.md` for the full promise protocol. Every agent must emit exactly one of these when finished:

- `<promise>AGENT_COMPLETE</promise>` -- replace AGENT with your role name (e.g., `ARCHITECT_COMPLETE`)
- `<promise>BLOCKED: [reason]</promise>` -- cannot proceed without human input
- `<promise>ESCALATE: [reason]</promise>` -- critical concern requiring immediate attention

### Severity Scale

When rating issues use the project severity scale. See `{knowledge_base}/severity-scale.md` for definitions of Critical / High / Medium / Low.
