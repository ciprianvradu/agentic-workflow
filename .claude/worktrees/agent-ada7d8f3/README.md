</p>

A multi-agent development workflow that orchestrates specialized AI agents through planning, implementation, and documentation phases.

**Supports Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode.**

> **New here?** Check out the [Visual Overview](docs/overview.md) -- a jargon-free guide with diagrams, perfect for managers, team leads, and anyone curious about how it works.

## Why Agentic Workflow?

Complex development tasks require multiple perspectives: architecture considerations, detailed planning, security review, edge case analysis, and careful implementation. Managing this manually with AI means constant context switching and oversight.

**Agentic Workflow** solves this by:

- **Orchestrating specialized agents** - Each agent has a focused role (architect, developer, reviewer, skeptic, etc.)
- **Maintaining human control** - Configurable checkpoints let you review and approve at critical stages
- **Supporting autonomous execution** - Loop mode handles repetitive fix tasks while you sleep
- **Preserving context** - Gemini integration provides massive context analysis; state files enable resumption

## Features

- **Multi-agent architecture** - 7 specialized agents for different concerns
- **Single agent consultation** - Quick `/crew ask` for second opinions without full workflow
- **Workflow modes** - Full, turbo, fast, minimal modes for different task complexity (`--mode`)
- **Human checkpoints** - Control points for review and approval at each phase
- **Loop mode** - Autonomous iteration until tests/build pass (Ralph Wiggum-style)
- **Effort levels** - Per-agent thinking depth calibration mapped to Anthropic API parameters
- **Server-side compaction** - Auto-summarizes conversation context approaching limits
- **Cost tracking** - Per-agent token usage and cost tracking with compaction support
- **Configuration cascade** - Global → Project → Task → CLI overrides
- **Gemini + Repomix integration** - Large-context codebase analysis for research phases
- **State management** - Resume interrupted workflows from any point
- **Model resilience** - Automatic failover with exponential backoff across model fallback chain
- **Git worktree support** - Isolated parallel `/crew` workflows with Jira integration and custom post-setup commands
- **Agent teams** - Experimental parallel agent execution via Claude Code agent teams
- **Beads integration** - Optional issue tracking integration
- **Technical documentation** - Automatic AI-context documentation updates

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Git
- One (or more) of the supported AI coding platforms:

| Platform | Install Guide |
|----------|--------------|
| Claude Code | [github.com/anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | [docs.github.com/copilot](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli) |
| Gemini CLI | [github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) |

### Optional
- [Repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) for intelligent file aggregation
- [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spiris-Innovation-Tech-Dev/agentic-workflow.git
cd agentic-workflow
./install.sh
```

Installs to:
- Commands → `~/.claude/commands/`
- Agents → `~/.claude/agents/`
- Scripts → `~/.claude/scripts/` (helper scripts referenced by agents/commands)
- Config → `~/.claude/workflow-config.yaml`

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Spiris-Innovation-Tech-Dev/agentic-workflow.git
cd agentic-workflow
.\install-copilot.ps1
```

Installs to:
- Agents → `.github/agents/` (repo-level) + `~/.copilot/agents/` (user-level)
- Config → `~/.copilot/workflow-config.yaml`
- MCP server → Python package + `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`
- Instructions → `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Gemini CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spiris-Innovation-Tech-Dev/agentic-workflow.git
cd agentic-workflow
./install-gemini.sh
```

Installs to:
- Agents → `~/.gemini/agents/crew-*.md` (sub-agents with YAML frontmatter)
- Config → `~/.gemini/workflow-config.yaml`
- Settings → `~/.gemini/settings.json` (enables experimental agents + MCP server)
- MCP server → Python package

Existing config files are backed up with a timestamp.

### Build Script (Advanced)

The `scripts/build-agents.py` script transforms shared agent sources (`agents/*.md`) and command sources (`commands/*.md`) into platform-specific formats. It substitutes template placeholders (`{__platform__}`, `{__platform_dir__}`, `{__scripts_dir__}`) so that built files reference the correct paths for each platform. Some agents are "command agents" (like `crew-worktree`) -- on Claude/OpenCode these become slash commands (`commands/`), on Copilot/Gemini they become regular agents with full tool access.

```bash
python3 scripts/build-agents.py claude                    # Build agents/ + commands/ to ~/.claude/
python3 scripts/build-agents.py copilot                   # Build .github/agents/
python3 scripts/build-agents.py gemini                    # Build ~/.gemini/agents/
python3 scripts/build-agents.py opencode                  # Build ~/.opencode/agents/ + commands/
python3 scripts/build-agents.py copilot --output /path    # Custom output directory
python3 scripts/build-agents.py --list-platforms           # Show available platforms
```

This is what `install.sh` and `install-copilot.ps1` call under the hood.

## Quick Start

### Simple task with checkpoints
```bash
/crew "Add user authentication with JWT"
```

### Loop mode (autonomous until tests pass)
```bash
/crew --loop-mode --verify tests "Fix all failing tests"
```

### From a task file
```bash
/crew --loop-mode --task ./tasks/implement-caching.md
```

### Overnight autonomous run
```bash
/crew --loop-mode --no-checkpoints --max-iterations 50

Migrate all API endpoints to v2:
- Update request/response types
- Add backward compatibility
- Update all tests
```

### Parallel work with git worktrees
```bash
# Claude Code
/crew-worktree "Add user profiles"

# Copilot CLI / Gemini CLI
@crew-worktree "Add user profiles"
```
Creates an isolated worktree — then run `/crew resume TASK_XXX` from there.

### With beads issue tracking
```bash
/crew --beads CACHE-12 --loop-mode
```

### Quick consultation (no full workflow)
```bash
# Get architect's opinion on a design decision
/crew ask architect "Should we use WebSockets or SSE for real-time updates?"

# Have skeptic review your plan for edge cases
/crew ask skeptic --plan .tasks/TASK_042/plan.md

# Reviewer check on specific code
/crew ask reviewer "Is this secure?" --context src/auth/
```

## Workflow Lifecycle

Each `/crew` invocation is a **complete cycle** that runs through all phases:

```
/crew "task" → Planning → Implementation → Documentation → Complete
```

### After Completion

When a crew finishes:
- All changes are made but **not committed** (unless you approve)
- Documentation updates are proposed
- The task state is saved in `.tasks/TASK_XXX/`

### Starting a New Task

If you have feedback or want changes after a crew completes, **start a new crew**:

```bash
# Original task completed, now want refinements
/crew "Refine the authentication - add rate limiting"
```

The new crew will:
1. See the changes from the previous task (they're in the codebase)
2. Run through all agents again with fresh analysis
3. Build on or modify the previous work

### Resuming Interrupted Work

If a crew is interrupted (you close the terminal, etc.), resume it:

```bash
/crew-resume           # Lists resumable tasks
/crew-resume TASK_042  # Resume specific task
```

### Why Start Fresh?

Each crew invocation brings fresh perspectives from all agents. For significant changes or new requirements, a new crew ensures:
- Architect re-evaluates system impact
- Developer creates a proper plan
- Reviewer and Skeptic validate the approach
- Full documentation cycle runs

For small tweaks, you can always make direct edits without using the crew.

### Agents

| Agent | Phase | Role | Output |
|-------|-------|------|--------|
| **Architect** | Planning | System design, boundaries, risks, integration points | Architectural analysis |
| **Developer** | Planning | Detailed step-by-step implementation plan | `TASK_XXX.md` with checkboxes |
| **Reviewer** | Planning | Plan validation, security review, pattern compliance | Review findings |
| **Skeptic** | Planning | Edge cases, failure modes, "3 AM scenarios" | Risk analysis |
| **Implementer** | Implementation | Execute plan step-by-step, verify each step | Completed task, test results |
| **Feedback** | Implementation | Detect deviations, classify severity, recommend fixes | Deviation analysis |
| **Technical Writer** | Documentation | Update AI-context docs with discovered patterns | Documentation updates |

### Agent Details

#### Architect (Planning Phase)
Analyzes system-wide implications before any code is written:
- Identifies affected modules and integration points
- Evaluates risks, constraints, and alternatives
- Raises questions requiring human decision
- Reviews security and performance implications

#### Developer (Planning Phase)
Translates architectural guidance into an executable plan:
- Creates detailed step-by-step instructions in `TASK_XXX.md`
- Specifies exact file paths, imports, and code changes
- Includes verification commands for each step
- Documents rollback procedures and warning signs

#### Reviewer (Planning Phase)
Validates the developer's plan before execution:
- Checks code syntax and pattern compliance
- Verifies security considerations are addressed
- Ensures test coverage is planned
- Identifies missing steps or ambiguities

#### Skeptic (Planning Phase)
Stress-tests the plan for real-world scenarios:
- Considers race conditions and concurrency issues
- Evaluates external dependency failure modes
- Questions assumptions and identifies risks
- Proposes additional test cases for edge cases

#### Implementer (Implementation Phase)
Executes the approved plan:
- Follows instructions precisely from `TASK_XXX.md`
- Runs verification after each step
- Reports any deviations or blockers
- Marks checkboxes as steps complete

#### Feedback (Implementation Phase)
Monitors implementation quality:
- Compares actual changes vs planned changes
- Classifies deviations (acceptable, concerning, critical)
- Validates against knowledge base patterns
- Escalates issues requiring human judgment

#### Technical Writer (Documentation Phase)
Captures knowledge for future AI sessions:
- Documents discovered patterns and conventions
- Updates `docs/ai-context/` files
- Validates existing documentation accuracy
- Captures non-obvious implementation details

## Commands

### `/crew`
Main command for starting or resuming workflows.

```bash
/crew [options] [task description]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--mode <mode>` | Workflow mode: `full`, `turbo`, `fast`, `minimal`, `auto` (default: auto) |
| `--loop-mode` | Enable autonomous looping until verification passes |
| `--no-loop` | Disable loop mode |
| `--max-iterations <n>` | Max attempts per step (default: 10) |
| `--verify <method>` | Verification: `tests`, `build`, `lint`, `all`, `custom` |
| `--no-checkpoints` | Skip human checkpoints (fully autonomous) |
| `--parallel` | Run Reviewer+Skeptic in parallel |
| `--beads <issue>` | Link to beads issue (e.g., `AUTH-42`) |
| `--task <file>` | Read task from markdown file |

### `/crew-worktree`
Create an isolated git worktree for a task, then stop. Available on all platforms.

```bash
# Claude Code
/crew-worktree "Add user profiles"
/crew-worktree SAD-289

# Copilot CLI
@crew-worktree "Add user profiles"

# Gemini CLI
@crew-worktree "Add user profiles"
```

Creates a worktree branch (`crew/task-xxx`) and working directory. Depending on the `worktree.auto_launch` config (`prompt` by default), it will offer to open a new terminal tab in the worktree with the AI CLI already running. If declined or set to `never`, it prints manual instructions instead. Run `/crew resume TASK_XXX` in the worktree to start the workflow. This keeps parallel tasks isolated from each other.

WSL/Windows note: the worktree's `.git` paths are automatically converted to relative paths so both WSL and Windows tools (Visual Studio, PowerShell git) can read the worktree.

### `/crew-status`
Display status of all active workflows.

```bash
/crew-status
```

Shows:
- Task ID and description
- Current phase and progress percentage
- Active agent
- Next steps and resume command

### `/crew-resume`
Resume an interrupted workflow.

```bash
/crew-resume [task-id]
```

Without `task-id`, shows a list of resumable tasks.

### `/crew-config`
View or modify configuration.

```bash
/crew-config
```

Interactive menu offering:
- View current settings
- Apply presets (Maximum Control, Fast Flow, Full Auto)
- Edit individual settings

### `/crew ask`
Invoke a single agent for quick consultation without starting a full workflow.

```bash
/crew ask <agent> <question> [options]
```

**Available Agents:**

| Agent | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| `architect` | System design, trade-offs, architectural decisions |
| `developer` | Implementation approach, code structure |
| `reviewer` | Code review, plan validation, correctness checks |
| `skeptic` | Edge cases, failure modes, what could go wrong |
| `feedback` | Comparing implementation vs plan |

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--context <path>` | Include specific files/directories as context |
| `--file <path>` | Read the question from a file |
| `--plan <path>` | Include a plan file (for reviewer/skeptic) |
| `--diff` | Include current git diff as context |
| `--model <model>` | Override model (default: opus) |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Quick architectural decision
/crew ask architect "Redis vs Memcached for our caching needs?"

# Review code with context
/crew ask reviewer "Is this auth implementation secure?" --context src/auth/

# Skeptic review of current changes
/crew ask skeptic "What could go wrong?" --diff

# Multi-line question
/crew ask architect

We're considering two approaches:
1. Direct Stripe integration
2. Payment abstraction layer

What are the trade-offs for future multi-provider support?
```

## Configuration

Configuration uses a cascade system where each level overrides the previous:

```
~/.claude/ or ~/.copilot/ or ~/.gemini/ or ~/.opencode/workflow-config.yaml   ← Global defaults
       ↓
<repo>/.claude/ or .copilot/ or .gemini/ or .opencode/workflow-config.yaml  ← Project overrides
       ↓
.tasks/TASK_XXX/config.yaml                                                  ← Task-specific
       ↓
Command-line args                                                            ← Highest priority
```

Platform directories are checked in order: `.claude` → `.copilot` → `.gemini` → `.opencode`, using whichever exists first.

### Configuration Reference

#### Checkpoints

Control when the workflow pauses for human approval:

```yaml
checkpoints:
  planning:
    after_architect: true      # Review architectural concerns
    after_developer: false     # Auto-proceed to reviewer
    after_reviewer: true       # Review gaps found
    after_skeptic: true        # Review edge cases

  implementation:
    at_25_percent: false       # Auto-proceed early
    at_50_percent: true        # Halfway review
    at_75_percent: false       # Auto-proceed to completion
    before_commit: true        # Always review before commit

  documentation:
    after_technical_writer: true

  feedback:
    on_deviation: true         # When implementation deviates
    on_test_failure: true      # When tests fail
    on_major_change: true      # When scope creeps
```

#### Loop Mode

Configure autonomous iteration behavior:

```yaml
loop_mode:
  enabled: false               # Override with --loop-mode

  phases:
    planning: false            # Planning needs human judgment
    implementation: true       # Loop until verification passes
    documentation: false       # Docs are one-shot

  max_iterations:
    per_step: 10               # Attempts per implementation step
    per_phase: 30              # Total iterations per phase
    before_escalate: 5         # Pause for human after N tries

  verification:
    method: tests              # tests | build | lint | all | custom
    custom_command: ""         # When method is "custom"
    require_all_pass: true     # For "all": tests AND build AND lint

  self_correction:
    enabled: true              # Analyze failures and retry
    max_same_error: 3          # Try different approach after N identical errors
    read_full_output: true     # Force reading complete error output

  escalation:
    on_repeated_failure: true  # Same error 3x = escalate
    on_scope_creep: true       # Deviation from plan = escalate
    on_security_concern: true  # Security changes = escalate
```

#### Agent Models

```yaml
models:
  orchestrator: opus
  architect: opus
  developer: opus
  reviewer: opus
  skeptic: opus
  implementer: opus
  feedback: opus
  technical-writer: opus
```

#### Gemini Integration

```yaml
gemini_research:
  enabled: true
  fallback_to_opus: true       # Use Opus if Gemini unavailable

  context_gathering:
    include_base_classes: true
    include_referenced: true
    include_examples: true
    include_docs: true
    max_files: 100

  error_handling:
    repomix_unavailable: fallback  # fallback | warn | fail
    gemini_unavailable: fallback
    gemini_timeout: 120
```

#### Beads Integration

```yaml
beads:
  enabled: false
  auto_create_issue: false     # Create issue when starting
  auto_link: true              # Link to mentioned issues
  sync_status: true            # Update issue status
  add_comments: true           # Add progress comments
```

#### Workflow Modes

```yaml
workflow_modes:
  default: auto                  # auto | full | turbo | fast | minimal
```

| Mode | Agents | Use Case | Est. Cost |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **full** | All 7 (Arch, Dev, Rev, Skeptic, Impl, Feedback, TW) | Complex features, critical changes | $0.50+ |
| **turbo** | Developer, Implementer, Technical Writer | Standard features (Opus 4.6 single-pass) | $0.15 |
| **fast** | Skip Skeptic and Feedback | Standard changes needing review | $0.25 |
| **minimal** | Developer, Implementer, Technical Writer | Simple fixes, typos | $0.10 |
| **auto** | Auto-detect based on task description | Default | varies |

#### Effort Levels

Per-agent thinking depth, mapped to Anthropic API parameters (`thinking: {"type": "adaptive"}`, `output_config: {"effort": "<level>"}`):

```yaml
effort_levels:
  full:
    architect: max               # Deep analysis with edge cases
    developer: max
    reviewer: high
    skeptic: max
    implementer: high
    feedback: high
    technical_writer: medium
  turbo:
    developer: max
    implementer: high
    technical_writer: medium
  # ... fast, minimal modes also defined
```

Values: `low` | `medium` | `high` | `max` (`max` is Opus 4.6 only; other models cap at `high`).

#### Compaction

Server-side conversation compaction via Anthropic API beta:

```yaml
compaction:
  enabled: true
  model: "compact-2026-01-12"   # Compaction model
  trigger_tokens: 80000         # Min tokens before compaction triggers
  pause_after_compaction: true  # Re-inject workflow state after compaction
  instructions: |
    Preserve: current task ID, workflow phase, implementation progress,
    active concerns, file paths being modified, test status.
    Discard: verbose tool outputs, intermediate search results,
    full file contents already processed.
```

When enabled, compaction auto-summarizes older conversation turns rather than dropping them. This replaces manual `workflow_flush_context` for context management.

#### Cost Tracking

```yaml
cost_tracking:
  enabled: true
  show_summary: true             # Display at workflow completion
  store_history: true
```

Tracks per-agent token usage (input, output, compaction) and calculates cost. Opus uses long-context pricing ($10/$37.50 per M) for >200K input tokens.

#### Git Worktrees

```yaml
worktree:
  base_path: "../{repo_name}-worktrees"
  branch_prefix: "crew/"
  cleanup_on_complete: prompt  # prompt | auto | never
  auto_launch: prompt          # prompt | auto | never
  ai_host: auto                # auto | claude | gemini | copilot
  copy_settings: true          # Copy host CLI settings to worktree
  install_deps: auto           # auto | never — auto-detect and install dependencies
  jira:
    auto_assign: never         # auto | prompt | never
    transitions:
      on_create:               # Fires when worktree is created
        to: ""                 # e.g., "In Progress"
        mode: auto
        only_from: []
      on_complete:             # Fires when workflow completes
        to: ""                 # e.g., "In Review"
        mode: auto
        only_from: []
      on_cleanup:              # Fires when worktree is cleaned up
        to: ""                 # e.g., "Test"
        mode: prompt
        only_from: []          # e.g., ["In Review"] — prevents Done→Test regression
  post_setup_commands: []      # Shell commands run after deps install
```

When `--worktree` is passed, the orchestrator creates an isolated git worktree for the task. Each worktree gets its own branch (`crew/task-xxx`) and working directory, allowing multiple `/crew` sessions to run in parallel without file conflicts. The `.tasks/` directory is shared — worktree agents resolve back to the main repo's `.tasks/` via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`.

**Auto-launch** controls whether the agent opens a new terminal in the worktree after creation:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `prompt` (default) | Ask "Launch a new terminal session in the worktree?" before opening |
| `auto` | Detect terminal and launch immediately without asking |
| `never` | Print manual instructions only (original behavior) |

The agent auto-detects the terminal environment (`$TMUX`, `wt.exe`, macOS Terminal) and generates the appropriate launch command. The `ai_host` setting controls which CLI is started in the new terminal — set to `auto` to use the platform default (`claude`), or explicitly set `claude`, `gemini`, or `copilot`.

**Host CLI differences:**

| | Claude | Gemini | Copilot |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Start CLI** | `claude` | `gemini` | `copilot` |
| **Invoke crew** | `/crew "task"` | `@crew "task"` | `@crew "task"` |
| **Resume in worktree** | `/crew resume TASK_XXX` | `@crew-resume TASK_XXX` | `@crew-resume TASK_XXX` |
| **Auto-launch prompt** | Sent automatically | Sent automatically (`-i` flag) | Manual paste required |

> **Note:** Copilot CLI doesn't accept prompt arguments. Auto-launch opens the terminal, but you must paste the resume prompt yourself.

**Worktree auto-setup**: The agent automatically prepares each worktree for immediate use:
- Symlinks `.tasks/` to the main repo so agents can read task state directly
- Copies `.claude/settings.local.json` (Claude only) so tool permissions are pre-approved
- Gemini and Copilot use global settings — no copy needed

Set `copy_settings: false` in the `worktree` config to disable settings copying (the `.tasks/` symlink is always created).

Set `install_deps: never` to skip automatic dependency installation — useful when your ecosystem isn't auto-detected (e.g., .NET, C++) or when you prefer `post_setup_commands` instead.

**Jira integration**: When a Jira issue key is passed to `/crew-worktree` (e.g., `/crew-worktree SAD-289`), the agent can automatically assign and transition the issue. Configure via `worktree.jira`:

- **`auto_assign`** (`auto` | `prompt` | `never`) — assign the issue to the current Jira user
- **`transitions`** — lifecycle hooks that fire at different stages:

| Hook | Fires when | Typical target |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| `on_create` | Worktree is created | "In Progress" |
| `on_complete` | Workflow finishes | "In Review" |
| `on_cleanup` | Worktree is cleaned up | "Test" |

Each hook has three fields:
- `to` — target Jira status (empty = skip)
- `mode` — `auto` | `prompt` | `never`
- `only_from` — list of statuses; only transition if the issue's current status is in this list (empty = always try). This prevents backward transitions — e.g., if QA already moved the issue to "Done", cleanup won't regress it to "Test".

All Jira operations degrade gracefully — if the Jira MCP server is unavailable, the agent warns and continues.

**Post-setup commands**: Run arbitrary shell commands after the worktree is fully set up (after dependency installation). Configure via `worktree.post_setup_commands`:

```yaml
worktree:
  post_setup_commands:
    - echo "Setting up {task_id} in {worktree_path}"
    - dotnet restore
    - npm run prepare
```

Supported placeholders: `{worktree_path}`, `{task_id}`, `{branch_name}`, `{main_repo_path}`, `{jira_issue}`. Commands run in order from the worktree directory. Failures warn but don't block.

**Example flow:**

```bash
# 1. Create the worktree (from your main repo)
/crew-worktree "Add user profiles"

# 2. Agent creates the worktree, then asks:
#    "Launch a new terminal session in the worktree? (yes/no)"
#
#    If yes (or auto_launch: auto):
#    - Detects terminal (tmux, Windows Terminal, macOS Terminal)
#    - Opens a new tab/window in the worktree directory
#    - Starts the AI CLI with the resume prompt pre-loaded
#
#    If no (or auto_launch: never):
#    - Prints manual instructions:
#      cd ../myrepo-worktrees/TASK_042
#      claude                     # or: gemini / copilot
#      /crew resume TASK_042      # or: @crew-resume TASK_042
```

Supported terminals:

| Terminal | How it launches |
|----------|----------------|
| **tmux** | `tmux new-window` in worktree directory with CLI running |
| **Windows Terminal** | `wt.exe new-tab` with bash running the CLI |
| **macOS Terminal** | `osascript` opens a new Terminal window |
| **Linux (other)** | Falls back to manual instructions (no reliable generic method) |

#### Agent Teams (Experimental)

```yaml
agent_teams:
  enabled: false                 # Requires Claude Code agent teams support
  parallel_review:
    enabled: false               # Reviewer+Skeptic as real teammates
  parallel_implementation:
    enabled: false               # Implementation steps as self-claimed tasks
    max_concurrent_agents: 3
```

When enabled, uses `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` for real multi-agent collaboration. Disabled by default — no behavior change for existing workflows.

#### Subagent Limits

Prevents runaway discovery loops where agents spawn subagents that loop for hours:

```yaml
subagent_limits:
  max_turns:
    planning_agents: 30          # Architect, Developer, Reviewer, Skeptic
    implementation_agents: 50    # Implementer
    documentation_agents: 20     # Technical Writer
    consultation_agents: 15      # /crew ask
  prefer_direct_tools: true      # Include tool discipline in agent prompts
  agent_timeout: 300             # 5 minutes per agent
```

All agents include "Tool Discipline" guidance: use Grep/Glob/Read directly instead of spawning Task subagents for codebase exploration.

#### Auto-actions

```yaml
auto_actions:
  run_tests: true
  create_files: true
  modify_files: true
  run_build: true
  git_add: false               # Require approval
  git_commit: false            # Require approval
  git_push: false              # Require approval
```

## State Management

All workflow state is stored in `.tasks/TASK_XXX/`:

```
.tasks/
└── TASK_001_jwt-authentication/
    ├── state.json           # Current phase, progress, checkpoints
    ├── task.md              # Original task description
    ├── config.yaml          # Effective config (cascaded)
    ├── architect.md         # Architect output
    ├── developer.md         # Developer output
    ├── reviewer.md          # Reviewer findings
    ├── skeptic.md           # Skeptic analysis
    ├── plan.md              # Final approved plan

```

### State File Format

  "task_id": "TASK_001",
  "description": "Add JWT authentication",
  "phase": "implementer",
  "phases_completed": ["architect", "developer", "reviewer", "skeptic"],

  "updated_at": "2024-01-15T12:30:00Z"
}
```

### Memory Preservation

Agents can save discoveries to persistent memory that survives context compaction:

```
.tasks/
└── TASK_001_jwt-authentication/
    └── memory/
        └── discoveries.jsonl    # Agent learnings in JSONL format
```

**Memory MCP Tools:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `workflow_save_discovery` | Save a learning to memory |
| `workflow_get_discoveries` | Retrieve saved learnings |
| `workflow_flush_context` | Get all learnings grouped by category (for context reload) |
| `workflow_search_memories` | Search learnings across multiple tasks |

**Workflow Control MCP Tools:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `workflow_get_effort_level` | Get recommended thinking effort for an agent |
| `workflow_record_cost` | Record token usage and cost (including compaction tokens) |
| `workflow_get_cost_summary` | Get cost breakdown by agent and model |
| `workflow_get_agent_team_config` | Check if agent teams are enabled for a feature |
| `workflow_create_worktree` | Record worktree metadata and get git commands |
| `workflow_get_worktree_info` | Check worktree status for a task |
| `workflow_cleanup_worktree` | Mark worktree cleaned and get cleanup commands |
| `workflow_get_launch_command` | Generate terminal launch commands for a worktree session |

**Discovery Categories:**

| Category | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| `decision` | Human decisions, architectural choices, trade-offs made |
| `pattern` | Code patterns, conventions, "how we do X here" |
| `gotcha` | Non-obvious issues, surprising behaviors, things that broke |
| `blocker` | Unresolved issues requiring human input |
| `preference` | User preferences discovered during the task |

See [docs/ai-context/memory-preservation.md](docs/ai-context/memory-preservation.md) for detailed usage guidance.

## Task Files

For complex tasks, create a markdown file:

```markdown
# Task: Implement Caching Layer

## Requirements
- [ ] Cache GET responses with configurable TTL
- [ ] Invalidate cache on POST/PUT/DELETE
- [ ] Add cache-control headers

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass
- Response time < 50ms for cached endpoints

## Technical Notes
- Use existing Redis connection from `src/lib/redis.ts`
- Follow patterns in `src/cache/base.ts`
- See `docs/api/caching.md` for API design

## Out of Scope
- Cache warming
- Multi-region cache sync
```

Run with:
```bash
/crew --loop-mode --task ./tasks/implement-caching.md
```

## Completion Signals

Agents output structured signals for state management:

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` | Agent finished successfully |
| `<promise>BLOCKED: reason</promise>` | Cannot proceed, needs input |
| `<promise>ESCALATE: reason</promise>` | Critical issue, needs human |

## When to Use What

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|----------|----------------------|
| Quick design question | `/crew ask architect "question"` |
| Second opinion on approach | `/crew ask skeptic` or `/crew ask reviewer` |
| New feature (needs design) | `/crew` (default with checkpoints) |
| Bug fix with clear repro | `/crew --loop-mode --verify tests` |
| "Make tests pass" | `/crew --loop-mode --verify tests` |
| "Fix the build" | `/crew --loop-mode --verify build` |
| Large refactor, review tomorrow | `/crew --loop-mode --no-checkpoints` |
| Security-sensitive changes | `/crew` (never skip checkpoints) |
| Overnight migration | `/crew --loop-mode --no-checkpoints --max-iterations 50` |
| Parallel tasks on same repo | `/crew-worktree "task"` (one worktree per task) |

## Gemini + Repomix Integration

When enabled, the workflow uses Gemini's massive context window to analyze your codebase:

1. **Repomix** aggregates relevant files (base classes, referenced code, examples, docs)
2. **Gemini** analyzes the aggregated context and produces sections:
   - `ARCHITECTURAL_CONTEXT` - For the Architect agent
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS` - For the Developer agent
   - `REVIEW_CHECKLIST` - For the Reviewer agent
   - `FAILURE_MODES` - For the Skeptic agent
   - `DOCUMENTATION_CONTEXT` - For the Technical Writer agent

3. Each agent receives only its relevant section, keeping context focused

If Gemini or Repomix are unavailable, the workflow falls back to direct file context with Claude.

## Examples

See the `/examples` directory:

- `fix-tests.md` - Loop mode example for autonomous test fixing
- `implement-caching.md` - Multi-requirement feature implementation

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow stuck in loop
Check `.tasks/TASK_XXX/errors.log` for repeated errors. The workflow escalates after `max_same_error` identical failures, but you can manually resume:
```bash
/crew-resume TASK_XXX
```

### Gemini analysis timeout
Increase the timeout in config:
```yaml
gemini_research:
  error_handling:
    gemini_timeout: 300  # 5 minutes
```

### Agent not following plan
The Feedback agent detects deviations. If `escalation.on_scope_creep: true`, the workflow pauses for human review. Check the deviation classification in the agent output.

### Resume after crash
State is persisted to `.tasks/TASK_XXX/state.json`. Run:
```bash
/crew-resume
```
to see all resumable tasks.

## Uninstall

### Claude Code
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI
```powershell
.\uninstall-copilot.ps1
```

### Gemini CLI
```bash
./uninstall-gemini.sh
```

All uninstallers preserve task state in `.tasks/`.

### Platform Details

#### Claude Code
- **Best experience** — `/crew` automates the full workflow end-to-end
- Agents installed to `~/.claude/agents/` as plain `.md` files
- Hooks enforce phase ordering (PreToolUse blocks wrong transitions, Stop hook ensures Technical Writer runs)
- MCP server auto-registered via `claude mcp add`
- Instructions in `CLAUDE.md`

#### GitHub Copilot CLI
- Agents installed to `.github/agents/` as `.agent.md` files with YAML frontmatter
- Orchestrator generates `crew.agent.md` which chains sub-agents via Copilot's agent delegation
- Invoke with `/agent crew-orchestrator` to run the full workflow, or reference individual agents (e.g., "Use crew-architect to...")
- Worktrees: `@crew-worktree "task description"` (generated as agent with full tool access)
- MCP server registered in `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`
- Instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- No hook enforcement — the MCP tools track state but don't block invalid operations

#### Gemini CLI
- Agents installed to `~/.gemini/agents/` as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter
- Sub-agents are **experimental** — requires `"experimental": {"enableAgents": true}` in `settings.json`
- Routing is autonomous: Gemini's main agent delegates to sub-agents based on their `description` field
- Each sub-agent has restricted tool access (read-only agents can't write files)
- Worktrees: `@crew-worktree "task description"` (generated as agent with shell + file tools)
- MCP server configured in `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- Instructions in `GEMINI.md`
- No hook enforcement

#### OpenCode
- Agents installed to `.opencode/agents/` as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter
- Commands installed to `.opencode/commands/` for slash command support
- Sub-agents use `mode: subagent` frontmatter with per-agent tool restrictions (boolean tool maps)
- Orchestrator uses `@crew-{agent}` mention syntax for delegation
- Reads `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` natively for project instructions
- Worktrees: `/crew-worktree "task description"` (command with `subtask: true`)
- MCP server registered in `opencode.json` (project-level)
- Multi-model support (75+ models including Claude, GPT, Gemini, local)
- No hook enforcement
