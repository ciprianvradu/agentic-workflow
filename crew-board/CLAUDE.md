# crew-board — Agent Instructions

Rust TUI dashboard for cross-project agentic-workflow task monitoring. Built with ratatui + crossterm.

## Build & Test

```bash
cd crew-board
cargo build                  # Dev build
cargo build --release        # Optimized binary (strip + LTO)
cargo test                   # All 17 unit tests
cargo clippy                 # Lint (fix all warnings before committing)
```

The release binary lands at `target/release/crew-board` (~1.6MB).

## Key Patterns

### Data Layer
- All structs use `#[serde(default)]` — tolerant of missing/extra fields
- `load_tasks()` and `load_issues()` silently skip malformed entries
- `.tasks/` symlinks in worktrees are resolved via `canonicalize()`
- Artifacts (architect.md, developer.md, etc.) are discovered at runtime from the task directory
- **metadata.json fallback**: When a task dir has no `state.json`, `load_tasks()` tries `metadata.json` (written by external setup scripts with a different schema). `TaskMetadata` struct deserializes it, `TaskState::from_metadata()` maps fields to a minimal TaskState, and the task is marked `archived: true`. The `jira_key` field lives on `LoadedTask` (not `TaskState`) since it's external metadata.
- **Incremental refresh**: `load_tasks_incremental()` compares `state.json` mtime against the stored `state_mtime` on each `LoadedTask`. Only tasks whose mtime changed are re-read from disk. `RepoData::load_incremental()` wraps this for the full repo. First load in `App::new()` is always a full `load_tasks()`.
- **`state_mtime` field**: `LoadedTask` carries `state_mtime: Option<SystemTime>` — the mtime of `state.json` at last read. `None` for archived/fallback tasks. This field powers the incremental refresh comparison.

### Navigation Model
- Tree view: flattened `Vec<TreeRow>` where `TreeRow` is either `Repo(idx)` or `Task(repo_idx, task_idx)`
- `expanded_repos: HashSet<usize>` tracks which repos are open
- `rebuild_tree()` must be called after any expand/collapse or data refresh
- Tree cursor clamps at boundaries (does not wrap around)
- Navigation methods: `tree_down()`, `tree_up()`, `tree_page_down(page_size)`, `tree_page_up(page_size)`, `tree_expand()`, `tree_collapse()`
- Key bindings: Up/Down/j/k for single step, PgUp/PgDn for page, Right/l to expand repo, Left to collapse repo

### Detail Pane Modes
```
Overview ──d──> DocList ──Enter──> DocReader
    │                      │            │
    │<─────Esc────────────Esc──────Esc──┘
    │
    │──h──> History
    │          │
    │<───Esc───┘
```
- `cached_artifacts` and `cached_task_dir` prevent re-scanning on every draw
- `ensure_artifacts()` is called on tree cursor change and refresh

### Event Loop
Keys are routed in priority order:
1. Help overlay open → any key closes it
2. Search popup open → search-specific keys
3. Create worktree popup open → popup keys (text input, selection, toggles)
4. Cleanup worktree popup open → popup keys (multi-select, toggles, preview)
5. Launch popup open → popup keys only
6. Right pane focused + non-Overview mode → doc/history navigation
7. Default → tree nav, view switching, shortcuts

**Esc behavior:** Esc never quits the application. It only closes popups, backs out of detail views, or switches focus from right pane to left pane. Use `q` or `F10` to quit.

### Refresh & Background Threading
All data refresh is **non-blocking**. `refresh()` spawns a background thread via `start_bg_refresh()`. Each event-loop tick calls `check_bg_refresh()` which polls `JoinHandle::is_finished()` and swaps in the new data on completion.

- **Incremental**: Background thread uses `RepoData::load_incremental()` — only re-reads `state.json` files whose mtime changed. Issues and config are still fully reloaded (single files, cheap).
- **Search index**: Built in the background thread alongside the refresh. The `Vec<SearchEntry>` is swapped in atomically with the new repos.
- **Timer reset**: `last_refresh` is reset on **completion** (not start), preventing rapid re-refresh if the background thread takes longer than `poll_interval_secs`.
- **Coalescing**: If a refresh is already in progress, `start_bg_refresh()` is a no-op. Multiple F5 presses or auto-refresh triggers are safely coalesced.
- **Callers affected**: `refresh()` is also called from `close_create_popup()` and `close_cleanup_popup()`. After the change these get non-blocking behavior — data appears after the next tick rather than synchronously.

### In-Memory Search Index
F3 search uses a pre-built `Vec<SearchEntry>` instead of scanning disk on every keystroke.

- **`SearchEntry`**: Holds `(repo_index, task_index)` plus pre-lowercased text segments (task_id, description, branch, phase, raw state.json, first 4KB of each .md artifact).
- **`build_search_index()` / `build_search_entry()`**: Module-level free functions (not `impl App` methods) so they can be called from both `App` methods and the background thread closure.
- **Index build**: Happens once on startup and again in each background refresh. Disk I/O (reading state.json + artifacts) only occurs during index build, never during search.
- **`run_search()`**: Iterates `self.search_index` in memory. First matching segment per task wins. Capped at 50 results.

### Worktree Creation (`F4` key)
Native Rust reimplementation of the core steps from `scripts/setup-worktree.py`. Press `F4` on a repo row to:
1. Enter task description (text input via `tui-input`)
2. Select AI host (Claude/Copilot/Gemini/OpenCode)
3. Toggle settings (pull latest, launch terminal)
4. Background thread runs git operations (~100ms vs ~2s for Python)
5. Shows result with task ID, branch, directory, color scheme
6. Optionally launches a color-themed terminal tab

**What it does:** Validates git repo, fetches/pulls, generates task ID (scans `.tasks/`), creates `state.json`, runs `git worktree add`, symlinks `.tasks/`, assigns color scheme, writes `.crew-resume` context file (see below).

**What it skips (deferred to AI agent):** Settings patching, dependency install, WSL path fix, post-setup commands, Jira transitions -- all handled by the agent on first `/crew resume`.

### `.crew-resume` Context File
At worktree creation, both `worktree.rs` and `scripts/setup-worktree.py` write a `.crew-resume` file to the worktree root. This file contains task_id, description, main_repo path, tasks_path, base_branch, ai_host, and the resume command. It is `.gitignore`d and never committed.

**Purpose:** AI hosts that cannot accept CLI prompt arguments (notably Copilot via `gh cs`) read this file to discover what task to resume. The launcher (`launcher.rs`) omits the prompt argument for Copilot and relies on `.crew-resume` instead. Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode still receive the resume prompt as a CLI argument.

The worktree is created at `../{repo-name}-worktrees/TASK_XXX` with branch `crew/{slugified-description}`.

### Worktree Cleanup (`F6` key)
Press `F6` on a repo row to clean up worktrees:
1. Multi-select worktrees with Space (completed tasks pre-selected, `a` toggles all)
2. Toggle settings: delete branch, keep on disk (recyclable)
3. Dry-run preview showing exact git commands and warnings (unmerged branches, incomplete workflows)
4. Background thread runs `scripts/cleanup-worktree.py` for each selected task
5. Shows results with success/failure per worktree

**Safety:** Only removes git worktree directories and branches. The `.tasks/` directory and all task artifacts are NEVER deleted.

**Modes:** Remove (git worktree remove + state update) or Recycle (mark recyclable, keep on disk for reuse).

### UI Style System
Central style helpers in `styles.rs` ensure visual consistency:
- `selected_style()` — blue background (#2A4A6B) for selected rows everywhere
- `focused_border_style()` / `unfocused_border_style()` — bold cyan vs dim gray borders
- `popup_selected_style()` — delegates to `selected_style()` (single source of truth)
- `hint_style()` — dim gray for keybinding hints

Pane focus is indicated by bold border + `◄` marker in the title. Detail pane titles show breadcrumb trails (e.g. `TASK_003 > Documents > Architect Analysis`).

Vertical scrollbars appear in both panes when content overflows the visible area. Uses ratatui's `Scrollbar` widget with `ScrollbarOrientation::VerticalRight`. The detail pane uses a shared `render_detail_scrollbar()` helper called from each rendering function.

### Status Bar (Norton Commander-style)
Two-line status bar:
- **Line 1**: View tabs + contextual navigation hints + aggregate stats
- **Line 2**: NC-style F-key bar: `F1Help  F2Launch  F3Search  F4New  F5Rfrsh  F6Clean  ...  F10Quit`

When a popup is open, line 2 shows popup-specific hints instead of the F-key bar.

### Color Schemes
8 schemes from Python `CREW_COLOR_SCHEMES` (state_tools.py), indexed by `color_scheme_index` from worktree state. Used for tree row accents, detail pane colors, and terminal tab colors.

`launcher.rs` provides `ColorSchemeHex` with hex strings for terminal commands:
- Windows Terminal: `--tabColor` and `--colorScheme` args to `wt.exe`
- tmux: `set-option window-style bg=...,fg=...`

## Adding a New Popup

Follow the pattern established by `launch_popup.rs` and `create_popup.rs`:
1. Create `src/ui/new_popup.rs` with `pub fn draw(frame, app)` using `centered_rect()` for positioning
2. Add popup state struct + step enum to `app.rs`
3. Add `Option<NewPopup>` field to `App` struct
4. Add lifecycle methods: `open_*`, `*_handle_key`, `close_*`
5. Register in `src/ui/mod.rs` — add `pub mod` and draw overlay call
6. Add key routing priority in `main.rs` event loop (popups go first)
7. Add keybinding hint in `status_bar.rs`

## Adding a New View

1. Create `src/ui/new_view.rs` with `pub fn draw(frame, app, area)`
2. Register in `src/ui/mod.rs` — add `pub mod` and dispatch in `draw()`
3. Add variant to `ActiveView` enum in `app.rs`
4. Add number key binding in `main.rs`
5. Add tab label in `status_bar.rs`

## Adding a New Data Source

1. Create parser in `src/data/new_source.rs`
2. Add field to `RepoData` in `data/mod.rs`
3. Load in `RepoData::load()` **and** `RepoData::load_incremental()`
4. Use `#[serde(default)]` on all fields for resilience

## Common Gotchas

- **Worktree paths**: The `worktree.path` field in state.json is relative. Use `launch.worktree_abs_path` for absolute paths.
- **WSL paths**: `wt.exe` runs on Windows side but receives Linux paths via `wsl.exe --cd`. Always include explicit `cd` in bash commands.
- **Login shells**: `bash -lic` sources profile which may reset cwd. Always prefix commands with `cd <dir> &&`.
- **Tree rebuild**: Forgetting `rebuild_tree()` after changing `expanded_repos` causes stale cursor state.
- **Detail mode reset**: Must reset `detail_mode` to `Overview` when tree cursor changes.
- **Popup priority**: Help overlay > search popup > create popup > cleanup popup > launch popup > detail nav > default. All must be checked before default key handling.
- **Background threads**: `create_worktree()`, `cleanup_worktree()`, and `refresh()` all run on `std::thread::spawn`. Poll `JoinHandle::is_finished()` each tick (250ms). No async runtime needed.
- **`F4`/`F6` key scope**: Only works on Repo rows — `open_create_popup()` and `open_cleanup_popup()` return early on Task rows.
- **Search index free functions**: `build_search_index()` and `build_search_entry()` are module-level free functions, not `impl App` methods. This is required because they are called from the background thread closure (which cannot capture `&self`).
- **`LoadedTask` construction sites**: When adding fields to `LoadedTask`, update all construction sites: 3 in `load_tasks()` (metadata fallback, normal state.json, gap-fill), plus the corresponding sites in `load_tasks_incremental()`. The `state_mtime` field must be `Some(mtime)` for normal tasks and `None` for archived/fallback tasks.
